# Tic-Tac-Toe Game
This is a simple tic-tac-toe game implemented in python using the pygame module. This game can be played on the command line or in any Pygame compatible GUI. The computer player is an AI model, created using the search algorithm minimax.

## Prerequisites 
* [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) - The programming language used
* [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/) - The Pygame library
* These can be installed with the command `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

## Installing
To install the game, simply clone this repo.

## How to Play
The game works as follows: 

1. When you open the game, you are presented with a screen to choose a player (either X or O).
2. Once you have chosen your player (X or O), you are presented with a 3x3 game board. 
3. Your objective is to get three of the same pieces in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal). 
4. Players take turns making the moves, and the first one to get three of their pieces in a row wins the game.

## Features
- A computer that always plays optimally, so the best you can do is manage a tie (good for practise!)
- Minimax implemented

## Built With
