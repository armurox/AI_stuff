# AI_stuff
This is a repository of some AI projects I have worked on! The techniques used range from basic search algorithms like minimax, all the way to more modern day machine learning techniques, using libraries such as scikit-learn and tensorflow. Please feel free to look into any particular directory here to get a better sense of each program.
