# AI_stuff
This is a repository of some AI projects I have worked on (from Harvard's CS50AI)! The techniques used range from basic search algorithms like minimax, all the way to more modern day machine learning techniques, using libraries such as scikit-learn and tensorflow. Please feel free to look into any particular directory here to get a better sense of each program.
